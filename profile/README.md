## About Bernskiold Media

[Bernskiold Media](https://bernskioldmedia.com) is a digital studio that creates ambitious websites, web and business applications that lets your business grow and makes your users happy.

We like to use WordPress for most of our website projects, and Laravel for most of our application projects. Most of our work wouldnâ€™t be possible without open source. Taking every chance to share and giving back is important to us.

Our open source work consists of WordPress plugins, WordPress helper libraries, Laravel packages and other frontend libraries that we use in our day-to-day client work too.

Here are some highlights:
